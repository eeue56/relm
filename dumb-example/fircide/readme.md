# A basic example of using Elm without rendering anything

## Motivation

Sometimes you might just want an Elm function to be accessed without storing any state within Elm

## How it works

Basically:

- Incoming port
- Outgoing port mapping a function to the incoming signal

## Usefulness

This is only useful as an example. It doesn't serve a purpose outside of being show that it's possible.
